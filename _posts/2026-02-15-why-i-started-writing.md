Four years ago, I stepped into a role I hadn't fully anticipated — working at the operational and policy heart of one of India's electricity distribution companies. What followed was an education that no classroom, coaching centre, or preparation manual could have given me.

This blog is my attempt to process that education. And to share it.

## The Gap I Kept Noticing

During my civil services preparation, energy was a topic. A chapter. Something you read about in economic surveys and summarised in answers about India's infrastructure challenges.

Then I actually worked in the sector.

The gap between what is written about energy in India and what actually happens — in substations, in revenue cycles, in regulatory hearings, in the daily grind of keeping the lights on for millions of consumers — is vast. Not because the writing is wrong, but because the texture of it is missing.

That texture is what I want to write about.

## What "Beyond the Meter" Means

The electricity meter is where the grid meets the consumer. Everything on the consumer side of the meter — the bill, the connection, the complaint — is what most people think about when they think about electricity.

But beyond the meter, upstream of it, is a world of extraordinary complexity. Generation assets, transmission corridors, load dispatch centres, power purchase agreements, regulatory tariff orders, AT&C losses, DISCOM finances, renewable integration challenges, smart grid pilots — a dense, interconnected system that quietly underpins modern life.

I've spent four years in that world. And I want to write about it in a way that is accessible, honest, and occasionally uncomfortable.

## What to Expect Here

I'll be writing across four broad areas:

**Civil services and governance** — the experience of being a civil servant, preparation reflections, and what the job actually looks like from the inside.

**Energy sector deep dives** — policy analysis, ground realities, reform assessments, and the stories behind the numbers.

**Techno-financial perspectives** — the intersection of capital, regulation, and technology that defines modern energy systems.

**Broader technology learnings** — digital public infrastructure, data, AI, and what they mean for governance and public services.

Some posts will be analytical. Some will be personal. All of them will be honest.

I'm glad you're here. Let's go beyond the meter.
