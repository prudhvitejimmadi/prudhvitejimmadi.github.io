## About Me

I'm Prudhvitej Immadi, an IAS officer from 2018 batch, Andhra Pradesh cadre. I graduated with electrical engineering from IIT Bombay in 2015. I worked in Samsung R&D in Seoul upto end of 2016. After that, I prepared for civil services examination and got 24 rank in CSE-2017.  

I have had a unique career trajectory after joining civil services 8 years ago. I got trained in Chittoor and worked as SDM in Kadapa district in my first posting upto 2021 August. Since then, I have been posted in various levels in Energy Department, Andhra Pradesh. I was initially working as Joint MD in APTRANSCO where I looked after Transmission Business and also bulk power purchase operations of the DISCOMs. From 2023 April, I have been working as CMD of AP Eastern Power Distribution Company. As such I got to spend more than 4 years at the helm of affairs in Energy Sector in Andhra Pradesh. 

This blog is my space to reflect, analyse, and share perspectives that sit at the crossroads of **energy**, **governance**, and **technology** — three domains that are increasingly inseparable in the India of today.

### What I Write About

**Civil Services & Governance**
The real texture of public administration — what the UPSC syllabus doesn't tell you, what field experience teaches you, and what it means to be a civil servant in a transforming India.

**Energy Sector in India**
From distribution reforms and the DISCOM crisis to renewable energy targets and grid modernisation — the policy, the ground reality, and the gap between them.

**Techno-Financial Dimensions of Energy**
The energy sector sits at the intersection of regulation, capital markets, technology, and public policy. I try to make sense of this complexity in plain language.

**Technology & Larger Learnings**
Broader reflections on digital public infrastructure, data governance, emerging technologies, and what they mean for a country like India.
