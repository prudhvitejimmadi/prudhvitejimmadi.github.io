## About Me

I'm Prudhvi — a civil servant with four years of experience at the helm of India's energy sector.

This blog is my space to reflect, analyse, and share perspectives that sit at the crossroads of **energy**, **governance**, and **technology** — three domains that are increasingly inseparable in the India of today.

### What I Write About

**Civil Services & Governance**
The real texture of public administration — what the UPSC syllabus doesn't tell you, what field experience teaches you, and what it means to be a civil servant in a transforming India.

**Energy Sector in India**
From distribution reforms and the DISCOM crisis to renewable energy targets and grid modernisation — the policy, the ground reality, and the gap between them.

**Techno-Financial Dimensions of Energy**
The energy sector sits at the intersection of regulation, capital markets, technology, and public policy. I try to make sense of this complexity in plain language.

**Technology & Larger Learnings**
Broader reflections on digital public infrastructure, data governance, emerging technologies, and what they mean for a country like India.
